# 📱 Time save – React Native App

**Time save** is a productivity-focused mobile application built with **React Native** that helps users manage and track their daily activities by assigning **credits** and **debits** based on behavior. The goal is to encourage healthier habits and a balanced lifestyle.

## 🧠 How it Works

- ✅ When the user completes positive or productive tasks (e.g., reading a book, doing laundry, washing dishes), they earn **credits**.
- ❌ When the user engages in less productive or passive activities (e.g., playing video games, watching TV), they incur **debits**.

Over time, users can visualize how balanced their day or week has been, helping them become more aware of their habits and make better decisions.

## 🔧 Built With

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) – Cross-platform mobile development

- Keep the app lightweight, intuitive, and visually rewarding.
